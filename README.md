## 🌟 Overview
**NyayAI** is an AI-powered platform designed to break down barriers in accessing legal information.

NyayAI changes this by:  
- **Simplifying legal language**  
- **Providing AI-powered legal guidance**  
- **Ensuring inclusivity with multilingual support**  
- **Building trust through real-world case references**

## ❓ Why NyayAI?
NyayAI is built to dismantle the **three walls** that stand between people and their rights:

| 🚧 Barrier | ⚡ Description |
|------------|----------------|
| 🧱 **Wall of Words** | Complex jargon in legal docs makes them incomprehensible for non-lawyers. |
| 💰 **Wall of Cost** | Expensive legal consultations make justice inaccessible for many. |
| 🤫 **Wall of Fear** | Fear of judgment/intimidation silences victims, especially women & children. |
